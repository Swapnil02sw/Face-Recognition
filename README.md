To maintain the attendance record with day-to-day activities is a challenging task. The
conventional method of calling the name of each student is time consuming and there is always
a chance of proxy attendance. The following system is based on face recognition to maintain
the attendance record of students. The daily attendance of students is recorded subject wise
which is stored already by the administrator. As the time for corresponding subjects arrives the
system automatically starts taking snaps and then applying face detection and recognition
technique to the given image and the recognized students are marked as present and their
attendance updated with corresponding time and subject id. We have used deep learning
techniques to develop this system. Our system is capable of identifying multiple faces in real
time. The main objective of this project is to develop a face recognition based automated
student attendance system.
